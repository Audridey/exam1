    <section><h1 id="heading">Introduction</h1>
    <p class="kailla">Hello netizen's.I am a Bimpi <abbr title="Basically not a party">(BNP)</abbr>  supporter.My name is Mahim khoka but people call me Kailla.Though they call me kailla , I don't scold them because I am a very nice person.By the way I made this website for a purpose and the purpose is to help people to know about the benefit of giving chada.
    </p>
        <h2 id="description">Reasons why you should give us chada</h2>
        <p class="kailla">We all know that the previous <abbr title="Prime Minister">PM</abbr> had fleed to india.After his departure here only one political party remains and it is the Bimpi <abbr title="Bascially NOt a Party">(BNP)</abbr>.They took million dollars from our country.So many sector of our country is suffered by the corruption of previous govt.Now it is our time to build up our nation.To build up our nation,we need many money.Our country is a developed country but most of the people of this country are still poor.Without the participation of these poor people,we can't develop.So for the people we invented a new type of tax and it is called chada.Most of the people know wrong about chada.That's why they consider it as a robbery.But in reality it is totally different from your expectation.Giving Chada is a very noble deed.The poor people aren't able to pay a huge amount of tax.But for them we are here.They don't need to pay a huge amount of tax.In this system they have to pay a little amount of money which is called chada.So,basically chada is called a little amount of money which is given by the poor people.It is performed for good purposes.But we consider it as a serious crime.But the reality is totally different. 
            <br>
            <br>
            So,give us chada as soon as possible.It will be good for you to give us chada earlier. <br>

  <h4>Analysis</h4>
  <div>Here is a table about different political parties and their chada type's:</div>
  <table >
    <tr>
        <th>Political Party</th>
        <th>Current Leader</th>
        <th>Chada Type</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>BIMPI</td>
        <td>Tareq Singh Chada</td>
        <td>10% Chada</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>BAL</td>
        <td>Shrek Hasina</td>
        <td>Gift</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Democratic Islamic Party(Jamat)</td>
        <td>Dd Amir</td>
        <td>Hadia</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>National Children's Party</td>
        <td>Sarjis Alam</td>
        <td>Donation</td>
    </tr>

  </table><br>
  <div>By analysing this table we can see that BNP only want 10% chada from people while other parties demand chada in higher rates which is very inhuman act.But our party is totally different.We take only 10% chada from poor people which is very lower than other parties.So now it depends on you which party will you choice.If you want to become a honest politician then join BIMPI. </div>
